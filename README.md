    <h1>Vulnerability Assessments</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This repository is dedicated to conducting and documenting vulnerability assessments for various projects. The assessments are divided into two main sections, each focusing on different sets of dependencies and potential vulnerabilities within them.</p>
    <h2>Vulnerability Check 1</h2>
    <p>The first vulnerability check focuses on a specific set of dependencies and outlines the methods used to assess and mitigate potential vulnerabilities found. This section has been detailed in the existing documentation and serves as the foundation for my vulnerability assessment efforts.</p>
    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Detailed analysis of specific dependencies</li>
        <li>Steps for replicating the vulnerability assessment</li>
        <li>Mitigation strategies for identified vulnerabilities</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more information on Vulnerability Check 1, please refer to the dedicated folder and README within this repository.</p>
    <h2>Vulnerability Check 2</h2>
    <p>The second vulnerability check expands our assessment to include additional dependencies, broadening the scope of our security evaluation. This section will document the tools, processes, and findings related to these additional dependencies.</p>
    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Comprehensive analysis of a new set of dependencies</li>
        <li>Instructions for conducting the vulnerability assessment</li>
        <li>Mitigation recommendations for new vulnerabilities discovered</li>
    </ul>
